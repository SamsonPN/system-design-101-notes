    "* this layer does not actually represent the software application itself but rather represents the set of protocols that determine how network communication is to take place\n",
    "    - for example, if you try to go to a website via your web browser, the application layer will use HTTP to initiate an HTTP request to get that website's resources like HTML/CSS/JavaScript to render that webpage in your browser\n",

    "    - if communication is between devices in the same network, then this layer is not necessary\n",
    "* it breaks up segments from the Transport layer into packets \n",
    "    - these packets are then reassembled on the receiving device for the Transport layer\n",

    "### Data Link\n",
    "* similar to the Network layer but works in transporting data between devices ON THE SAME NETWORK\n",
    "    - Network layer does work between networks\n",
    "* this layer takes the packets from the Network layer and breaks them down further into frames\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical\n",
    "\n",
    "* this layer represents the physical mediums by which data transfer takes place\n",
    "    - things like cables, switches, etc\n",
    "* the data is converted into a bit stream (1s and 0s)\n",
    "    - the physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices"
